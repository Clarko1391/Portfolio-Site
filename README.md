# Portfolio-Site
 Abandoned design of my portfolio site. This was chalked up to a combination of too many design changes during implementation as well as a lack of experience in HTML/CSS

This project is hosted on Github Pages if you would like to view it, however, it is now obsoleted and will not see any changes. This was a great learning experience in terms of understanding the importance of sticking to a properly fleshed out design and not trying to write the source code before having a solid idea of what is to be built
